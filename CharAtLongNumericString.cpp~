For the string S generated by the pattern
1234567891011121314151617181920
find the digit at the x location.




S is generated by appending the string representation of all integers from 1 to D where D is the last integer value. The length of S is determined by the number of integers counted and the number of characters used to represent each integer in string form. Highest power of 10 in the integer determines the number of characters required to express the value.

With x, find the n 'power of 10' range where the x character falls,  i.e. 
  10^n < x < 10^(n+1) 

One approach would be to incrementally subtract from x the number of characters used to express each power-of-10 range

1-9                 =   9     values * 1 digit  = 9     characters
10-99               =   90    values * 2 digits = 180   characters
100-999             =   900   values * 3 digits = 2700  characters
1000-9999           =   9000  values * 4 digits = 36000 characters
...                 =   9 * 10^n * n = z

Determine which integer exists in the range at x-10^n into the current range, i.e.
  i = (x - 10^n) / n
Then the character number in that integer, i.e.
  c = (x - 10^n) % n

Finally return the 'c' character in the string representation of the 'i' integer, i.e.
  digit = itoa(i)[c];
